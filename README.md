Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm42y6WEwmc

## Overview
A 2D grid-based simulation where autonomous agents learn to navigate
towards a target position using Q-learning.

## Key Concepts
- Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning)
- State–action value tables
- Exploration vs exploitation
- Reward shaping

## Implementation
- Language: Lua
- Discrete grid environment
- Custom reward function
- Deterministic and stochastic movement modes
